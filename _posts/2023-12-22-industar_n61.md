## Introduction
I have a terrible habit of picking up old cameras, lenses and assorted photo gear from eBay or other sites simply because its cheap. One of these impulse buys I made around a year and a half ago was that of a FED-4 rangefinder, a 35mm camera from the days of the Soviet Union, specifically from Kharkiv in the Ukrainian SSR. Personally, I bought the camera because it was a hulking metal machine built in a state long dead, and because I had been wanting to play around with a rangefinder. As it turns out, the star of the whole camera is the detachable Industar И-61 lens, which I really like. Both the body and lens have an interesting history though, and the designs have surprising origins. 

## The NKVD's Camera
The FED line of cameras derive their names from Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky, a Bolshevik revolutionary who had headed the Cheka and the OGPU, the feared secret police of the embryonic Soviet states during the revolutionary and civil war period. In 1926 he fell ill after spending a hours long speech denouncing other bolsheviks for opposition to Stalin, specifically the United Opposition within the Central Committee lead by Trotsky. In the wake of his death as the head of the secret police, the constituent republics named cities and villages for Dzerzhinsky. One place he lent his name to in death, was a small "Children's Labour Commune" where orphaned children were put to work making machinery while, officially, learning skills and earning a wage. Eventually around 1932 the FED commune moved on from simple mechanics to making clones of the famed Leica camera and also moved on to more skilled labour. I assume the quality of the cameras improved when traumatised orphans stopped being part of the workforce. 

Not content to just have Dzerzhinsky be the namesake of the commune and resulting factory enterprise, as far as I can tell the NKVD (the successor to the OGPU) took partial control of the factory during the early Stalinist era, and some FED-1 cameras have the NKVD logo embossed on the body. During WW2, the FED factory was evacuated to Siberia and workers of the factory were put to work making fuel pumps for Lavochkin La-5 and La-7 fighters. 

Eventually as the years wore on the FED factory began to iterate and build on the basic Leica II design they used. In the case of the FED-4, it added some additional shutter speeds and a huge honking light meter. Like, it adds an extra 50% of height compared to it's predecessors. It's pretty nifty but I can't be sure of its accuracy and the settings for the light meter use GOSS numbers instead of ISO/ASA numbers for film sensitivity to light. Sadly, with the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, and the newly independent Ukrainian state being forced to implement shock therapy to careen into economic liberalisation, the FED factory stopped producing cameras for good but seemed to continue producing parts for tanks and aircraft. 

## Industar, the People's Zeiss lens 
Industar, in comparison, does not refer to a specific commune or factory, but was a common brand name given to multiple types of lens made across the Soviet Union. While the Industar И-61 was made by and for FED, the Industar name was also applied to other lens with 4 optical elements in 3 groups. To add to the confusion, one type of Industar lens could be made by multiple factories (which may or may not include their factory logo on the lens). Based on my own research, a И-61 is based on the Carl Zeiss Tessar (or Leitz Elmar) design which might have been transferred from Nazi Germany at the end of WW2 as part of war reparations following the Third Reich's defeat at the hands of the Soviet Red Army and the Western Allies. While quality control within the Soviet Union's photographic factories and communes were lax compared to major workshops in the west, my little Industar seems to a nearly perfect lens. My only complaints are from its age, not the pictures it creates. 

Specification wise, my Industar И-61 is a 53mm prime lens without a lanthanum coating on the lens elements based on the 2.8/53 inscription around the front element. The focal length varies with batch, but I think most are around 53mm. The maximum aperture is f2.8 but can shoot down to f16. While sharpness increases as you increase the f-stop, it's still impressively sharp when shot wide open along with f2.8 exhibiting a pleasant but understated bokeh effect. As it was built for a Leica inspired camera, it retains a M39 (also known as a Leica 39) screw mount lens. 

## Shooting the И-61
I have so far had the chance to shoot my И-61 on two very different camera bodies. The original FED-4 body I got it with, and a modern Canon EOS M mirrorless camera. 

#### FED-4
The FED-4 is, unsurprisingly, well paired with the И-61 but there is a slight issue. As the lubricant on the focusing wheel on the lens has began to either harden or has disappeared, the wheel movement is not smooth and can make focusing a slight pain in the neck. This is further aggravated by the FED-4's' tiny rangefinder window which isn't particularly bright or clear. 

However, the images produced by the И-61 on film are excellent. The quality of the glass in its arrangement produce very clear and high resolution images with nice contrast. This is especially evidence on film like Ilford HP5+, with its small grain and its wide latitude it gives you with getting the correct exposure. The following image was captured using Kentmere KPAN 400, a B&W film similar to HP5+. I feel it captured a lot of the detail around the bricks and good contrast within the darker portions of the image.

However, due to the sheer size of the FED-4, I haven't had much chance to shoot with it bar a few test rolls in my back garden or on some short walks. 

#### Canon EOS M

In order to shoot with the И-61 on such a new camera, I had to purchase a cheap M39 to Canon EF-M lens adaptor and set the camera to manual control. As the EOS M did not support focus peaking out of the box, I also had to install the free Magic Lantern software, unlocking focus peaking on the device. This makes focusing on a subject with a manual lens much easier compared to the regular built in zoom focusing. As mentioned before, the focus wheel has not aged well and the lubricant is substandard. This means that sometimes that trying to turn the focus ring can require more force than the adaptor needs to turn the entire lens, and so you start to turn the entire lens instead of just the focusing wheel. 

Another small issue is that as the Industar was designed for a 35mm format camera, the APS-C sized sensor of the EOS M applies a crop factor of 1.6x to the focal length of the И-61. This is kinda like a optical form of cropping an existing image to a small size, essentially zooming into the subject in the process. The 1.6x crop factor turns the 53mm focal length into 86mm, meaning that you end up being quite far away from subjects compared to shooting the И-61 on a 35mm body. This can make shooting with the И-61 difficult in a close knit settings, like concerts or nights out, where I do most of my shooting. 

Despite these slight issues, the И-61 performs well on the digital body too. With some homebrew film simulation settings on the EOS M, you can get some really pleasing JPEGs out of the EOS M, despite the lens and body being from two different eras and worlds. At f2.8 and the fairly large APS-C sensor, you can get a lot of light into the image, and  the live preview of the digital system makes going up a f-stop much easier without underexposing the image. One of my shots was with my favourite model:

Alternatively, golden hour clouds also proved to be nice to shoot on the glass. I especially think the lens gives a nice vintage look on the camera here, the colour of the sunset hits the clouds makes it look almost like a painting.

## Conclusion

Though I haven't found a way to shoot this one regularly yet, between the compromises of adapting it to digital or the size of the FED-4, this might be my favourite lens. It definitely has the most interesting origins of any lens in my small collection - intertwined with the rise and fall of the Soviet Union and based on imitation followed by innovation. 

I'm a big fan.
